# 6502 Simulator

This project is a simulator dedicated to the 6502-Microprocessor from 80s.
The program is a desktop application in which you can write a C program for this microprocessor, compile it and simulate the binary code on the microprocessor.

The backend logic of the desktop application (e.g. the entire simulatrion of the microprocessor) is written in Rust. The frontend is written with the Nextjs, React, JavaScript stack.

I hope you enjoy my little project and maybe you can spot some bugs or error and can help me make it better and more fun.
